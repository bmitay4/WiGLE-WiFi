# Ariel University, Object-Oriented Programming Course

This project is builded and maintained as an assignment of OOP course, at Ariel University

## Getting Started

The purpose of this project is to build a complex system that enables the collection of geographic information, the production of insights from this information, and the presentation of information in graphical tools.

For the average user, no previous knowledge is required. The programmer, preferably advanced knowledge in JAVA, to understand the source files well.

### Motivation

Have you ever wondered if you can get geographic information about your route during the day?

Have you ever entered the subway or underground car park and lost your self-location?

Have you ever wondered how many wireless networks are around you? And what is their closeness to you?

In order to solve all these questions and more, we have built an application that will show you your exact location, even in difficult terrain or in underground areas.
